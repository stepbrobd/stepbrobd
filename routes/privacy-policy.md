# Privacy Policy

Welcome to the website of StepBroBD Inc. ("we," "us," "our"). This Privacy
Policy applies to all visitors of our website.

## What Information We Collect and How

As we use Plausible Analytics and Heap Analytics to collect analytics data, the
information collected might include but not be limited to:

- page views
- bounce rate
- referral information
- device type
- browser type
- operating system
- country or city of the user

This data is aggregated and anonymized, and we do not collect personal
information such as names, addresses, or email addresses. We do not allow for
user opt-out of data collection, as it is necessary for the functionality of our
website. Both analytics platforms we use are GDPR compliant.

## How We Store and Protect the Information We Collect

The data we collect is stored securely with our analytics providers, Plausible
Analytics and Heap Analytics. They both use security measures such as encryption
and firewalls to protect data from unauthorized access.

## Do We Share Personal Information, and with Whom

We do not share personal information as we do not collect it. The anonymized and
aggregated data collected may be shared with third parties for the purpose of
improving our website and services.
